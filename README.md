# Kiva Analysis and Modelling

This research analyzes the relationship between poverty levels and microloan distribution in Kenya, utilizing datasets from Kiva, a microfinance platform. The study integrates geographic and statistical techniques to assess the effectiveness of microloan allocations in addressing poverty.

### Introduction
Poverty remains a significant challenge in Kenya, with various regions experiencing different levels of economic hardship. Microfinance institutions such as Kiva play a crucial role in providing financial assistance to underserved communities. This study evaluates poverty estimates and microloan trends to understand their impact on economic development.


The research employs data visualization and statistical modeling to analyze datasets on poverty estimates and Kiva loans. Data preprocessing ensures accuracy in county-level poverty assessments. The study integrates geospatial mapping using leaflet and sf libraries in R to visualize poverty distribution. Trend analysis and predictive modeling with ARIMA and Prophet models forecast loan distribution trends.

### Data Sources

*Overall Poverty Estimates: Provides percentage distribution of poverty across Kenyan counties.*

*Hardcore and Food Poverty Estimates: Highlight extreme poverty conditions and food insecurity.*

*Kiva Loans Dataset: Contains information on loan amounts, sectors, and geographical distribution.*

*Shapefiles: Used for mapping poverty distribution across counties.*

### Findings

The highest poverty gaps are observed in counties such as Turkana, Mandera, and Wajir.

Microloans are predominantly allocated to agriculture, retail, and education sectors.

A geographical disparity exists in loan distribution, with urban counties receiving more loans than rural ones.

Predictive analysis indicates an increasing trend in microloan disbursement, suggesting growing microfinance engagement.

Discussion
The study highlights that while microloans significantly impact economic activities, their distribution remains uneven. The correlation between poverty intensity and loan distribution suggests that targeted lending strategies could improve the effectiveness of microfinance interventions.

Conclusion
Microfinance initiatives have the potential to alleviate poverty in Kenya, but strategic loan allocations are necessary for maximum impact. Further research should focus on borrower success rates and loan repayment behaviors.
