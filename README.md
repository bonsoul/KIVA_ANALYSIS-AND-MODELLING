# Kiva Analysis and Modelling

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Understand the poverty index in Kenya across all the counties.

Analyze the distribution of loan amounts funded through Kiva.

Identify the sectors receiving the most funding.

Visualize the geographic distribution of loans.

Evaluate repayment trends and key factors influencing successful repayments.

Develop a time series model to predict future loan trends.

Data Overview

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on Kiva loans, including loan amounts, borrower details, sectors, repayment statuses, and geographic locations. Visualizations and predictive modeling techniques were applied to generate insights.

Key Findings

Poverty Index Analysis

Significant variation in poverty levels was observed across different counties in Kenya.

Counties with higher poverty rates received a larger share of microloans, particularly in the Agriculture and Retail sectors.

Loan Amount Distribution

Most loans were small, with a right-skewed distribution.

Larger loan amounts were directed towards Agriculture and Manufacturing sectors.

Sector Insights

Agriculture, Retail, and Food sectors received the majority of loans.

The Education and Health sectors had fewer loans, indicating potential gaps.

Geographic Distribution

Developing regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, received substantial loan funding.

Certain countries exhibited a higher volume of small-scale loans, particularly in the Retail sector.

Repayment Trends

High repayment rates were observed in Agriculture and Services sectors.

Longer loan terms correlated with lower default rates.

Female borrowers demonstrated higher repayment rates.

Gender and Social Impact

A significant portion of loans were issued to women, supporting the empowerment of female entrepreneurs.

Time Series Model

A predictive time series model suggests a steady increase in loan applications.

The forecast indicates higher loan demands, especially in sectors with robust repayment rates.

Conclusion

The analysis highlights that Kiva's funding model effectively supports sectors with high social impact. The findings suggest opportunities for further targeted funding in underserved sectors like Education and Health.
